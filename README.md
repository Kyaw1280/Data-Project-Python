# YouTube Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes YouTube video data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Summary

- **Data Collection:**  
  Collected YouTube video data, including features like views, likes, comments, publish time, and channel information.

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Processed the dataset to handle missing values, converted data types, and formatted timestamps for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Analyzed distributions of views, likes, and comment counts.
  - Explored trends over time and relationships between video features.
  - Identified factors correlated with video popularity.

- **Visualization:**  
  Used libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize key insights, including:
  - View and like distributions
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Trends over time

- **Insights:**  
  Summarized findings on what influences YouTube video performance, highlighting patterns and outliers in the data.
